This project provides an automated solution for attendance management and secure access control using Arduino, RFID technology, and a servo motor. When an RFID tag is scanned, it records key data—like name, roll number, and entry time—in an Excel sheet, ensuring reliable attendance tracking. A brief delay prevents duplicate entries, and the system activates a servo motor to unlock the door only after a successful scan, enhancing security by allowing only registered individuals access.

Built with cost-effective components like the Arduino Uno, RC522 RFID reader, and servo motor, this system offers a scalable, budget-friendly solution adaptable to classrooms, offices, or secured facilities. It saves time, minimizes errors, and strengthens security by automating attendance and entry authorization—an ideal choice for environments needing efficient attendance and access control.

Helps understand use of RFID and ardiuno connections.
